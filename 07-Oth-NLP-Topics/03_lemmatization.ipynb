As a result, stemming can sometimes produce root forms that are not actual words.\n","\n","- For example:\n","  - `\"jumping\" → jump\"`\n","  - `\"flies\" → \"fli\"`\n","\n","**Lemmatization:**\n","\n","- **Lemmatization** is a text normalization technique that aims to reduce words to their base or root form by **considering the word's meaning and context**.\n","\n","- It converts words to their `lemma` or `dictionary form`, which is a valid word.\n","\n","- **Lemmatization** typically involves looking up a word in a `lexical resource` (like a dictionary) to find its base form.\n","\n","- For example:\n","  - `\"jumping\" → \"jump\"`\n","  - `\"flies\" → \"fly\"`\n","\n","\n","In summary, while both **stemming** and **lemmatization** are used for text normalization in NLP.\n","\n","- **lemmatization** is a more sophisticated technique that considers the meaning and context of words, resulting in more accurate base forms.\n","\n","- Stemming, on the other hand, uses heuristic rules and may produce root forms that are not actual words.\n","\n","The choice between `stemming` and `lemmatization` depends on the specific requirements of the NLP task and the level of linguistic accuracy needed.\n","\n","Lemmatization is often preferred when working with tasks that require a deeper understanding of language, such as information retrieval or machine translation, while stemming may be suitable for simpler tasks like text classification or search engine
