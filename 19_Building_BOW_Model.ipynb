        "\n",
        "For almost any ML algorithm to function correctly, the data must adhere to two specific rules:\n",
        "1.  **Tabular Form**: The data must be structured in rows (observations) and columns (features).\n",
        "2.  **Numerical Features**: The training features must be numbers. Algorithms cannot natively understand raw text strings like \"The lion is the king\".\n",
        "\n",

        "1.  **Extract word tokens**: Break down the text into individual words.\n",

        "\n",
        "### The Vocabulary\n",
        "First, we extract the unique words (vocabulary) from the entire corpus. Note that in this raw example, case sensitivity matters (\"The\" vs \"the\") and plurals are distinct (\"lion\" vs \"Lions\").\n",

        "**Vocabulary**: `a`, `an`, `decade`, `endangered`, `have`, `is`, `jungle`, `king`, `lifespans`, `lion`, `Lions`, `of`, `species`, `the`, `The`\n",

Text Preprocessing</span><br>\n",

        "1.  **Lowercasing**: Converting \"Lions\" and \"lion\" $\\rightarrow$ \"lion\", \"The\" and \"the\" $\\rightarrow$ \"the\".\n",
        "2.  **Removing Punctuation**: Stripping symbols like `. , ! ?`.\n",
        "3.  **Removing Stopwords**: Removing common words that carry little meaning (e.g., \"is\", \"of\", \"the\").\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benefits:\n",
        "*   **Smaller Vocabularies**: Fewer columns in our data table.\n",
