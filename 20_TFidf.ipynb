        "\n",
        "### Understanding n-gram Modeling\n",
        "In n-gram modeling, the weight of a dimension is dependent on the frequency of the word corresponding to that dimension.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Example**: If a document contains the word `human` in five places.\n",
        "*   **Result**: The dimension corresponding to `human` has a weight of **5**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Motivation for Better Vectors\n",
        "While simple frequency counts are useful, they have significant drawbacks when analyzing a corpus of documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Problem:**\n",
        "*   Some words occur very commonly across **all** documents.\n",
        "*   Consider a corpus of documents about the universe.\n",
        "    *   One document has `jupiter` and `universe` occurring 20 times each.\n",
        "    *   `jupiter` rarely occurs in the other documents, but `universe` is common across the whole corpus.\n",
        "    *   Simple frequency weighting treats them equally (both weight 20).\n",
        "    *   **Goal**: We want to give more weight to `jupiter` on account of its **exclusivity** to that specific document.\n",
        "\n",
