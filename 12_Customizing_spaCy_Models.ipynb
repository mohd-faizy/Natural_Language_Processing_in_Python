        "**Common Specific Domains:**\n",
        "*   **Twitter Data:** Contains slang, hashtags, and informal grammar.\n",
        "*   **Medical Data:** Contains complex pharmaceutical names, symptoms, and diagnosis codes (e.g., \"pulmonary fibrosis\", \"atrial fibrillation\").\n",

        "### Assessing Model Performance\n",
        "\n",
        "Before starting the training process, you should ask:\n",
        "1.  Do the default spaCy models perform well enough on our data?\n",

        "### Summary\n",
        "In this notebook, we explored the advanced capabilities of spaCy, specifically focusing on **custom model training**. We learned that while pre-trained models are powerful, specific domains like medicine or social media often require custom training data to achieve high accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
        "1.  **Data Preparation is Key:** The quality of your model depends heavily on the quality and format of your annotated data (List of tuples with character offsets).\n",
        "2.  **The `Example` Object:** spaCy v3 requires converting raw text and annotations into `Example` objects for training.\n",
        "3.  **Training Loop:** We must disable unrelated pipeline components, shuffle data, and iterate through epochs to update model weights using `nlp.update`.\n",
        "4.  **Persistence:** Trained models can be saved to disk and reloaded for inference in production environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next Steps\n",
        "*   **Practice:** Create a custom dataset for a domain you are interested in (e.g., sports, finance).\n",
        "*   **Experiment:** Try training a model from scratch (blank language model) versus updating an existing one to see the difference in performance.\n",
        "*   **Explore:** Look into spaCy's config system (`config.cfg`) for more advanced hyperparameter tuning and training configurations.\n"
