        "Raw text is often messy and inconsistent. To a machine, \"Dogs\" and \"dog\" are completely different strings, even though they represent the same concept. Similarly, \"won't\" and \"will not\" mean the same thing but look different.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
        "1.  **Tokenization**: Breaking text into meaningful units (words/punctuation) is the first step in understanding text structure.\n",
        "2.  **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base forms normalizes the text and reduces vocabulary size.\n",
        "3.  **Text Cleaning**: Removing noise (stopwords, punctuation, special characters) is crucial, but must be done carefully to avoid losing valuable information (like proper nouns with numbers).\n",
        "4.  **POS Tagging**: Identifying grammatical roles helps in disambiguating meaning and analyzing sentiment.\n",
        "5.  **NER**: Extracting real-world entities (People, Orgs, Locations) adds semantic understanding to the text processing pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Next Steps:**\n",
        "With these features extracted and cleaned, your text data is now ready for vectorization (e.g., Bag of Words, TF-IDF) and subsequent modeling in machine learning algorithms.\n"
