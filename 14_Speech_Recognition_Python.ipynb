        "2.  **AudioFile & AudioData**: You must convert file handles (`AudioFile`) into raw data (`AudioData`) using `record()` before transcription.\n",
        "3.  **Flexibility**: The library supports multiple APIs (Google, Bing, Wit) and languages.\n",
        "4.  **Limitations**: It does not natively handle speaker diarization (multiple speakers) and requires clean audio or noise adjustment for best results.\n",
        "5.  **Debugging**: Use `show_all=True` to inspect raw API responses and confidence scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Next Steps:**\n",
        "*   Try recording your own voice using a microphone (using `sr.Microphone()` instead of `sr.AudioFile()`).\n",
        "*   Experiment with different `energy_threshold` settings for noisy environments.\n",
        "*   Integrate this into a larger NLP pipeline to analyze the sentiment of the transcribed text.\n"
