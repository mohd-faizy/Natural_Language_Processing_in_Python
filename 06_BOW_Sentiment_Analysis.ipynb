        "\n",
        "The **Bag-of-Words (BOW)** model is a fundamental concept in Natural Language Processing (NLP) used to transform text into numerical features that machine learning algorithms can understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
        "*   **Occurrence Description**: It describes the occurrence of words within a document or a collection of documents (known as a **corpus**).\n",
        "*   **Vocabulary Building**: It builds a vocabulary of all unique words found in the corpus and creates a measure of their presence (usually a count).\n",
        "*   **Loss of Structure**: As the name implies, it treats text as a \"bag\" of words, disregarding grammar rules and word order.\n",

If two documents contain the word \"excellent\" multiple times, they are likely to have a similar positive sentiment. </div>\n",
