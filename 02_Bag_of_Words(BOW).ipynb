        "The **Bag-of-words (BoW)** model is a fundamental method in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for finding topics within a text. It simplifies text data by disregarding grammar and word order, focusing entirely on **word frequency**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Principles:**\n",
        "*   **Tokenization:** You must first break the text into individual units called tokens (words).\n",
        "*   **Counting:** You count the occurrence of every token.\n",
        "*   **Frequency = Importance:** The underlying assumption is that the more frequent a word is, the more significant it is to the meaning of the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example\n",
        "Consider the following text:\n",
        "> \"The cat is in the box. The cat likes the box. The box is over the cat.\"\n",
        "\n",
