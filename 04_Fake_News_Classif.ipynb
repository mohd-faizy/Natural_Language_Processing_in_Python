        "Translation is difficult because context matters.\n",
        "*   **Example**: A tweet \"god bless the german language\" accompanied by a complex German sentence illustrating how difficult it is to translate specific economic terms.\n",

        "Words have different sentiments depending on the context (community or topic).\n",

        "    *   In `r/sports`: \"big men are very **soft**\" (Negative sentiment).\n",

        "In this notebook, we explored the fundamentals of classifying text using supervised learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
        "1.  **Supervised Learning**: Requires labeled data. In NLP, we convert text labels (like \"Sci-Fi\") into numerical categories.\n",
        "2.  **Feature Extraction**: We cannot feed raw text into a model. We used `CountVectorizer` (Bag-of-Words) to turn plot summaries into numerical vectors.\n",
        "3.  **Modeling**: We used the **Naive Bayes** classifier, a probabilistic model highly effective for text data.\n",
        "4.  **Evaluation**: We used accuracy scores and the **Confusion Matrix** to understand prediction errors.\n",
        "5.  **Ethics**: We acknowledged that NLP models can struggle with context and perpetuate real-world biases (e.g., gender bias in translation).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Next Steps:**\n",
        "*   Try using `TfidfVectorizer` instead of `CountVectorizer` to see if weighting unique words improves accuracy.\n",
        "*   Experiment with different classifiers like Logistic Regression or Support Vector Machines (SVM).\n",
        "*   Audit your datasets for potential biases before training models for production.\n"
